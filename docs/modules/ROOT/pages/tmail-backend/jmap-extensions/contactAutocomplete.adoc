= JMAP contact autocomplete
:navtitle: JMAP contact autocomplete

This extension allows users, when composing an email, to search recipients in his list of domain and personal contacts
based on his input.

== Additions to the capabilities object

Servers supporting the JMAP contact autocomplete extension advertise it via the
`com:linagora:params:jmap:contact:autocomplete` capability.

The value of this property in the JMAP session capabilities property is an empty object.

The value of this property in an accountâ€™s accountCapabilities property is an empty object.

== Contact

The `Contact` object represents a personal or domain contact related to the user.

It has the following fields:

- *id*: `String, immutable`. The computed identifier of the Contact.
- *email*: `String, immutable`. The email address of the Contact.
- *firstname*: `String, mutable, optional`. The firstname of the Contact.
- *surname*: `String, mutable, optional`. The surname of the Contact.

Example:

....
{
  "id": "02242f08-515c-4170-945e-64afa991f149",
  "emailAddress": "bparker@linagora.com"
  "firstname": "Bob",
  "surname": "Parker"
}
....

== TMailContact/autocomplete

The method is similar to a standard `/query` JMAP method, simplified.

It takes the following arguments:

- *accountId*: `Id` The id of the account to use.
- *filter*: `ContactFilter` Determines the set of contacts returned in the result. The filter is mandatory here.
A `ContactFilter` has one property:
  * *text*: `String` The input on which the user is trying to perform an autocomplete on his contacts.
- *limit*: `UnsignedInt|null` The maximum number of results to return. If null, no limit presumed. The server MAY choose
to enforce a maximum limit argument. In this case, if a greater value is given (or if it is null), the limit is clamped
to the maximum; the new limit is returned with the response so the client is aware.

The response has the following arguments:

- *accountId*: `Id` The id of the account used for the call.
- *list*: `Contact[]` The list of contacts matching the filter query from the request. Note that the autocomplete method
does a full search on the email address, while only doing a partial search for names just looking at the first characters.
- *limit*: `UnsignedInt` (if set by the server) The limit enforced by the server on the maximum number of results to
return. This is only returned if the server set a limit or used a different limit than that given in the request.

== Example

Suppose the user has 2 personal contacts:

- {"email": "john@domain.tld", "firstname": "John", "surname: "Doe"}
- {"email": "marie@otherdomain.tld", "firstname": "", "surname: ""}

And 2 domain contacts:

- {"email": "bparker@linagora.com", "firstname": "Bob", "surname: "Parker"}
- {"email": "mdupond@linagora.com", "firstname": "Marie", "surname: "Dupond"}

The user is composing a new email and start typing the recipient he is looking for, doing a JMAP autocomplete method
towards TMail backend for finding his contact:

....
{
  "using": ["urn:ietf:params:jmap:core", "com:linagora:params:jmap:contact:autocomplete"],
  "methodCalls": [[
    "TMailContact/autocomplete",
    {
      "accountId": "29883977c13473ae7cb7678ef767cbfbaffc8a44a6e463d971d23a65c1dc4af6",
      "filter": {"text":"marie"}
    },
    "c1"]]
}
....

Will return:

....
{
  "sessionState": "${SESSION_STATE.value}",
  "methodResponses": [
    [
      "TMailContact/autocomplete",
      {
        "accountId": "29883977c13473ae7cb7678ef767cbfbaffc8a44a6e463d971d23a65c1dc4af6",
        "list": [{
          "id": "2",
          "firstname": "",
          "surname": "",
          "emailAddress": "marie@otherdomain.tld"
        }, {
          "id": "4",
          "firstname": "Marie",
          "surname": "Dupond",
          "emailAddress": "mdupond@linagora.com"
        }]
      },
      "c1"
    ]
  ]
}
....
