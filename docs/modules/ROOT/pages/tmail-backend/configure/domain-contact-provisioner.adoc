== Domain contact provisioner listener
:navtitle: Domain contact provisioner listener

This listener will index a contact for the domain every time a user is created,
or will remove it everytime a user is deleted.

This can be used to avoid waiting for a synchronisation with a ldap job and that users can have that
new user in their contacts when belonging to the same organization and when composing an email.

It is also possible to configure a list of domains that will be ignored by this listener, useful for example
not indexing users part of a saas b2c offer.

Sample configuration: `listeners.xml`

....xml
<listeners>
  <listener>
    <class>com.linagora.tmail.james.jmap.contact.DomainContactProvisionerListener</class>
    <configuration>
      <ignoredDomains>lin-saas.com,stg.lin-saas.com</ignoredDomains>
    </configuration>
  </listener>
</listeners>
